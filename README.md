### Hey it is me Malo Braunschweig but you can call me by my nickname AluSinVIII (pronounce it Hallucinate). 👻

I am a Web Devlopment student at the Institute of Internet and Multimedia in Paris, La Defense. 🏙

Just like many of my comrades, I am a big fan of inovation and new technologies,
but I am also convinced that a lot of things must move along the informatic progresses. 🚀
I am speaking here about us, humans, which should never be forgotten in the process, but also our land, earth, and all the ecosystem. 🌍

This is why I am willing to make projects which pursues my objectifs and morality, and help all of us to grow through this decades of fantastic innovations.

This said, here is a quick resume of me at the moment this README is written:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own mobile application "SelfCare" which will help everyone to be organized and self-confident.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things as I am still a student, but I guess I can be more precise and say I am currently learning Kotlin and Cypress.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on new types of project, I would absolutely love to work on a project linked to music.
- 💬 Ask me about Selenium and Script Automation as I worked all summer on this technologie/stack.
- 📫 How to reach me: Dont hesitate to DM me on Discord: "Alu Sin VIII#9605" or send me an e-mail at "malo.braunschweig@live.fr"
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an absolute fan of Hard Rock, and one day, u will be able to see me singing on stage ! 💥💥
